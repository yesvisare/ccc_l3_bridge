    "\n",
    "This bridge validates readiness to transition from **M9.1 Query Decomposition** to **M9.2 Multi-Hop Retrieval**. While M9.1 shipped parallel sub-query execution with dependency graphs, it falls short on queries requiring reference-chain following (e.g., \"Find audit findings for CA-2024-001\"). Production impact: 15-25% of queries need multi-hop retrieval, yet current systems achieve only 40% answer quality on these cases—costing ₹25L monthly in manual support work. M9.2 introduces automatic reference extraction, recursive retrieval with stop conditions, and knowledge graph traversal to close this gap."
