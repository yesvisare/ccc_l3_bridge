    "## Section 1: RECAP - What M9.3 HyDE Shipped\n",
    "\n",
    "### Achievements from M9.3 Hypothetical Document Embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **LLM-powered hypothesis generator**  \n",
    "Built system that transforms user queries into document-style answers, achieving 80%+ domain-appropriate hypotheses with GPT-4o-mini and domain context prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Hybrid retriever with RRF fusion**  \n",
    "Implemented Reciprocal Rank Fusion combining HyDE and traditional retrieval, improving precision 15-40% on vocabulary-mismatch queries while maintaining performance on well-phrased queries\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Query classifier with adaptive routing**  \n",
    "Created factoid detection and vocabulary overlap checker (85%+ accuracy), routing only 30-40% of queries to HyDE to avoid latency/cost overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Semantic cache achieving 30-40% hit rate**  \n",
    "Reduced effective latency from 500ms to 325ms by caching hypotheses for similar queries using embedding similarity threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Outcome:\n",
    "Precision improved 58% for queries where users and documents speak different languages (vocabulary mismatch).\n",

Ensemble Cross-Encoder Systems with Voting**\n- Combine 2-3 cross-encoder models with different strengths\n- Use majority voting or weighted averaging\n- Improve accuracy 8-12% while optimizing latency <200ms P95\n\n**2. MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) for Diversity**\n- Balance relevance vs diversity using MMR algorithm\n- Parameter λ controls trade-off (λ=1: pure relevance, λ=0: pure diversity)\n- Ensure top-5 results have 3+ unique sources\n\n**3. Temporal Boosting & Personalized Ranking**\n- Apply recency scoring with exponential decay\n- Learn user preferences from click data (CTR-based personalization)\n- Combine 4 signals: relevance + recency + diversity + personalization\n\n### Key Question for M9.4:\n\n**\"Your retrieval returns the right documents. But how do you rank them optimally considering recency, diversity, and user preferences—without adding 500ms latency?\"**\n\n### Reality Check:\n\n80-90% of use cases **don't need** advanced reranking. A single cross-encoder is sufficient if your content is:\n- Evergreen (doesn't change over time)\n- Naturally diverse (no redundancy in top results)\n- Used by anonymous users (no personalization needed)\n\nAdvanced reranking is specifically for:\n- News/regulatory content (recency critical)\n- Research/analysis (diversity valuable)\n- Personalized systems (user preferences matter)\n\n---\n\n**Bridge Complete!
