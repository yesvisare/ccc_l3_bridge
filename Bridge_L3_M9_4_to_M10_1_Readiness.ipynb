    "# BRIDGE: M9.4 Advanced Reranking → M10.1 ReAct Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This bridge validates that Module 9's **static retrieval pipeline** components meet production thresholds before transitioning to Module 10's **dynamic agentic reasoning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Critical Shift:** Module 9 gave you powerful retrieval techniques that follow predetermined sequences. Module 10 introduces agents that dynamically select tools and reasoning paths based on query requirements—a paradigm where 25-35% of enterprise queries that fail with static pipelines can now succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** Weak Module 9 foundations (query decomposition, multi-hop retrieval, HyDE routing, reranking) will be amplified by agentic behavior. This notebook ensures you're ready before agents introduce unpredictability requiring extensive safety nets."
