    "# Bridge L3: M13.2 → M13.3 Readiness Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This bridge validates the shift from **Governance & Compliance** (M13.2) to **Launch Preparation & Marketing** (M13.3). You've built enterprise-grade compliance ($200K–500K revenue potential); now ensure your foundation is solid before scaling customer acquisition 10x through deliberate launch planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: Proper launch preparation prevents the \"$0 revenue despite incredible product\" scenario by treating go-to-market as a first-class deliverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compliance readiness**: Verify GDPR, SOC 2, incident response, and evidence automation artifacts exist\n",
    "- **Demo tier validation**: Confirm Free, Professional, and Enterprise tenant configurations\n",
    "- **Production stability gates**: Check 1K req/hour capacity, P95 latency <3s, <1% error rate\n",
    "- **Market validation (PractaThon)**: Test value propositions with real prospects before launch\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## After Completing\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Verify all M13.2 compliance deliverables are production-ready\n",
    "- ✅ Confirm demo tenants showcase value across pricing tiers\n",
    "- ✅ Validate production SaaS meets stability targets for enterprise customers\n",
    "- ✅ Document market feedback from 5+ prospects on value propositions and pricing\n",
