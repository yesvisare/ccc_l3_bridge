    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "You've completed M13.3 (Launch Preparation) by deploying your SaaS, establishing pricing, and executing initial marketing. Before advancing to M13.4 (Portfolio Showcase), this bridge validates that your production system, documentation, and performance meet baseline standards. This ensures you have portfolio-ready artifacts to transform into career-advancing materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production readiness validation**: Verifying live deployment with functional sign-up and queries\n",
    "- **Repository documentation standards**: Checking comprehensive README and module organization\n",
    "- **Performance benchmarking**: Confirming scale through load test metrics\n",
    "- **Challenge completion verification**: Validating landing page, pricing, and marketing artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "## After Completing\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Confirmed your SaaS meets production deployment standards\n",
    "- ✅ Verified GitHub repository is portfolio-ready with clear documentation\n",
    "- ✅ Validated system performance at scale (1,000+ req/hour, P95 < 3s)\n",
    "- ✅ Documented completion of M13.3 challenges (landing page, pricing, marketing)\n",
    "- ✅ Ready to create architecture diagrams, demo video, and case study in M13.4\n",
