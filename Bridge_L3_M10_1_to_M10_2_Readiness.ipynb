This bridge validates your agent is production-ready before M10.2, where you'll add a multi-tool ecosystem with sandboxing, timeouts, and validation so your agent can safely execute Calculator, Database, API, Slack, and Chart tools without crashing or security vulnerabilities."

    "\n",
    "### Technical Capabilities Unlocked\n",
    "\n",
    "In M10.1 Augmented, you built a working ReAct agent with:\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ Multi-Step Reasoning**  \n",
    "Your agent breaks down complex queries into reasoning steps.  \n",
    "- Query: \"Compare Q3 to Q4 revenue and calculate percentage change\"  \n",
    "- Agent autonomously plans: search Q3 → search Q4 → calculate difference → calculate % → answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ Thought-Action-Observation Loop**  \n",
    "The core ReAct cycle:  \n",
    "- Agent thinks → Selects action → Executes tool → Observes result → Reasons about next step  \n",
    "- Loop repeats until sufficient information is gathered\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ State Management**  \n",
    "Your agent maintains context across reasoning steps.  \n",
    "- Remembers Step 1 context when making Step 4 decisions  \n",
    "- No amnesia between actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ Failure Prevention Mechanisms**  \n",
    "You built safeguards:  \n",
    "- Loop detection (prevents infinite cycles)  \n",
    "- Max iterations limit (stops after 8 steps)  \n",
    "- Fallback to static pipeline (when agent fails)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Experience Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ Agent Reasoning Traces**  \n",
    "You can diagnose where reasoning went wrong by reading Thought → Action → Observation logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ Performance Profiling**  \n",
    "You measured:  \n",
    "- P95 latency: 7-10s for 4-step reasoning  \n",
    "- Average steps per query: 3-4 for complex queries  \n",
    "- Tool selection accuracy: 80-85%\n",
    "\n",
    "**✓ Decision Framework**  \n",
    "You know when to use agents vs static pipelines:  \n",
    "- Agents: Complex multi-tool queries (<10% of traffic)  \n",
    "- Static pipelines: Simple retrieval (90%+ of traffic)\n",
    "\n",

    "- Call external APIs (requires API call tools)\n",
    "- Send notifications (requires Slack tool)\n",
