   "source": "# BRIDGE: M9.2 Multi-Hop Retrieval → M9.3 HyDE\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis bridge validates your M9.2 multi-hop retrieval system is ready for M9.3 Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE). Multi-hop handles reference chains; HyDE solves vocabulary mismatch (when users ask in natural language but documents use formal terminology). Before adding HyDE's 500-1000ms overhead, you must confirm your base retrieval is fast, accurate, and produces high-quality context.\n\n## Concepts Covered\n\n- **Readiness validation** for four critical dependencies: knowledge graph structure, reference extraction precision, multi-hop latency, and relevance threshold\n- **Graceful degradation** patterns for offline/stub testing when external services unavailable\n- **Performance budgeting** for HyDE integration (current latency determines if HyDE overhead is acceptable)\n\n## After Completing\n\n- ✓ Verified knowledge graph has hub documents (≥5 references) for HyDE example generation\n- ✓ Confirmed reference extractor precision ≥85% (no hallucinated doc_ids)\n- ✓ Measured P95 multi-hop latency <2s (HyDE will add +500-1000ms)\n- ✓ Validated Hop 2 relevance ≥0.7 (quality context for hypothetical answer generation)\n\n## Context in Track\n\n**Bridge L3.M9.2 → L3.M9.3** (Module 9: Advanced Retrieval Techniques)  \n**Duration:** 8-10 minutes (validation only, no implementation)\n\n---\n\n## Run Locally (Windows)\n\n```powershell\n# Set PYTHONPATH and launch Jupyter\npowershell -c \"$env:PYTHONPATH='$PWD'; jupyter notebook\"\n```\n\nFor Linux/macOS:\n```bash\nPYTHONPATH=$PWD jupyter notebook\n```\n\n---"

   "source": "## Section 6: CALL-FORWARD — What M9.3 HyDE Will Introduce\n\n---\n\n### The Problem: Vocabulary Mismatch\n\nYour advanced multi-hop retrieval works perfectly when user queries and documents share similar language. But what happens when:\n\n**User asks:** \"tax implications of stock options\"  \n**Document contains:** \"equity compensation taxation framework under IRC Section 409A\"\n\n**Result:** Dense retrieval fails due to **vocabulary mismatch** (30-40% of queries in specialized domains).\n\n---\n\n### M9.3 Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE) — Three Critical Capabilities\n\n#### 1. Hypothetical Answer Generation\n- Instead of embedding the user query, generate a hypothetical answer using LLM\n- Embed the hypothetical answer (which uses document-style language)\n- Search for documents similar to hypothetical answer\n- **Bridges the vocabulary gap** between user language and document language\n\n#### 2. Hybrid Retrieval (HyDE + Traditional Dense)\n- Combine HyDE results (good for mismatch queries) with traditional dense search\n- Deduplicate and merge results\n- Dynamically route: Use HyDE only when vocabulary mismatch detected\n- **Best of both worlds:** precision for formal queries + recall for natural queries\n\n#### 3. Cost-Performance Optimization\n- HyDE adds 500-1000ms latency + $0.001-0.005 per query\n- Implement caching for repeated queries\n- A/B test: Measure if HyDE actually improves retrieval for your domain\n- **Route intelligently:** 20-30% of queries benefit, 70-80% don't need it\n\n---\n\n### Key Question for M9.3\n\n**\"Your retrieval works for well-phrased queries. But when users use natural language and your docs use formal terminology, how do you bridge that gap?\"**\n\n**The Answer:** HyDE generates a hypothetical answer in document-style language, then searches for documents similar to that hypothetical answer.\n\n**The Twist:** HyDE only helps 20-30% of queries (those with vocabulary mismatch). For the rest, it adds latency with zero benefit. M9.3 teaches you **when to use it and when to skip it**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Module\n\nProceed to **M9.3 Concept: Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)** to implement vocabulary mismatch detection and hypothetical answer generation.",
