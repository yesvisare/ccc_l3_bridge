    "## Section 1: RECAP — What M9.2 Multi-Hop Retrieval Shipped\n",
    "\n",
    "M9.2 delivered enterprise-grade multi-hop retrieval with the following achievements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Knowledge Graph with Neo4j\n",
    "- Built document relationship graph tracking references\n",
    "- Calculated PageRank importance scores (hub documents surface automatically)\n",
    "- Provided citation trails for compliance requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ LLM-Powered Reference Extractor\n",
    "- Implemented GPT-4o-mini extraction with **85%+ precision**\n",
    "- Validated references against Pinecone corpus\n",
    "- Prevented hallucinated document IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Recursive Retriever with 5 Stop Conditions\n",
    "- `max_hops=3` (maximum traversal depth)\n",
    "- Visited tracking (prevent cycles)\n",
    "- `relevance_threshold=0.7` (quality gate)\n",
    "- `timeout=10s` (performance constraint)\n",
    "- No-refs-found detection (graceful termination)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Completeness Improvement: 40% → 87%\n",
    "- Reference-chain queries now retrieve all linked documents\n",
    "- Answer quality improved by **25%** for 15-25% of queries with cross-references\n",
    "- Critical for legal, medical, and compliance systems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** You've built a system that handles queries single-shot RAG and query decomposition couldn't solve. You're following citation trails automatically."

   "source": "## Section 6: CALL-FORWARD — What M9.3 HyDE Will Introduce\n\n---\n\n### The Problem: Vocabulary Mismatch\n\nYour advanced multi-hop retrieval works perfectly when user queries and documents share similar language. But what happens when:\n\n**User asks:** \"tax implications of stock options\"  \n**Document contains:** \"equity compensation taxation framework under IRC Section 409A\"\n\n**Result:** Dense retrieval fails due to **vocabulary mismatch** (30-40% of queries in specialized domains).\n\n---\n\n### M9.3 Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE) — Three Critical Capabilities\n\n#### 1. Hypothetical Answer Generation\n- Instead of embedding the user query, generate a hypothetical answer using LLM\n- Embed the hypothetical answer (which uses document-style language)\n- Search for documents similar to hypothetical answer\n- **Bridges the vocabulary gap** between user language and document language\n\n#### 2. Hybrid Retrieval (HyDE + Traditional Dense)\n- Combine HyDE results (good for mismatch queries) with traditional dense search\n- Deduplicate and merge results\n- Dynamically route: Use HyDE only when vocabulary mismatch detected\n- **Best of both worlds:** precision for formal queries + recall for natural queries\n\n#### 3. Cost-Performance Optimization\n- HyDE adds 500-1000ms latency + $0.001-0.005 per query\n- Implement caching for repeated queries\n- A/B test: Measure if HyDE actually improves retrieval for your domain\n- **Route intelligently:** 20-30% of queries benefit, 70-80% don't need it\n\n---\n\n### Key Question for M9.3\n\n**\"Your retrieval works for well-phrased queries. But when users use natural language and your docs use formal terminology, how do you bridge that gap?\"**\n\n**The Answer:** HyDE generates a hypothetical answer in document-style language, then searches for documents similar to that hypothetical answer.\n\n**The Twist:** HyDE only helps 20-30% of queries (those with vocabulary mismatch). For the rest, it adds latency with zero benefit. M9.3 teaches you **when to use it and when to skip it**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Module\n\nProceed to **M9.3 Concept: Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)** to implement vocabulary mismatch detection and hypothetical answer generation.",
