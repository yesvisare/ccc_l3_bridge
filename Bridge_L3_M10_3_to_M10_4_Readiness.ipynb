    "# Bridge L3: M10.3 Multi-Agent Orchestration → M10.4 Conversational RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**What shifts:** You've built a multi-agent system that orchestrates complex tasks through specialized agents (Planner, Executor, Validator). Now you need to add **conversational memory** so agents can maintain context across multiple dialogue turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Without memory, 60-70% of real user interactions fail. Users must repeat context in every query, references like \"it\" or \"that\" can't be resolved, and iterative refinement becomes impossible. This bridge validates your orchestration is stable before layering memory on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delta from M10.3:**\n",
    "- **Readiness validation** for multi-agent coordination, state management, and orchestration stability\n",
    "- **Context loss identification** through conversation logging exercises\n",
    "- **Gap analysis** showing what breaks when agents lack memory across turns\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## After Completing This Bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- ✓ Verify multi-agent system handles complex queries requiring 3+ sub-tasks\n",
    "- ✓ Confirm state persists correctly across agent transitions (Planner → Executor → Validator)\n",
    "- ✓ Validate LangGraph orchestration runs without deadlocks or infinite loops\n",
    "- ✓ Track coordination overhead through monitoring metrics\n",
    "- ✓ Identify what context is lost between conversation turns using a conversation logger\n",
    "- ✓ Articulate why memory is essential for multi-turn dialogue\n",

    "\n",
    "In **M10.3: Multi-Agent Orchestration**, you built:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Built a 3-agent system with specialized roles**  \n",
    "   - Planner breaks down complex queries  \n",
    "   - Executor completes tasks using tools  \n",
    "   - Validator provides independent quality control\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Implemented inter-agent communication using LangGraph**  \n",
    "   - Structured message passing with state management  \n",
    "   - Conditional routing and feedback loops for validation\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Deployed coordination monitoring tracking agent performance**  \n",
    "   - Latency per agent, iteration counts, rejection rates  \n",
    "   - Coordination overhead measured with Prometheus\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Created decision frameworks for single vs multi-agent selection**  \n",
    "   - Multi-agent improves quality 15-30% on complex tasks  \n",
    "   - Identified when it's overkill (simple queries, real-time, low budget)\n",
    "\n",
