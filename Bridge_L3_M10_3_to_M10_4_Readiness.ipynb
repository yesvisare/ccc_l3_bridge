It can't resolve \"which one\" because it forgot the previous conversation. Each query is treated as isolated.\n\n**The Solution:** Conversational memory enables agents to:\n\n1. **Two-level conversation memory architecture**\n   - Short-term memory: Last 5-10 turns (verbatim storage)\n   - Long-term memory: Summarized history beyond 10 turns\n\n2. **Reference resolution techniques**\n   - Identify pronouns and map to entities from recent turns\n   - Resolve \"it\", \"that\", \"these\", \"the previous one\"\n   - 80-90% accuracy on reference resolution\n\n3. **Session management at scale**\n   - Redis-backed storage for 10K+ concurrent conversations\n   - Memory summarization when conversations exceed token limits\n   - Context window optimization\n\n### The Impact\n\n**Without memory:**\n- Users waste 30-45 seconds per conversation repeating context\n- 40-50% of follow-up queries fail due to missing references\n- Users abandon after 2-3 turns instead of exploring 10-15 turns\n\n**With memory:**\n- Natural multi-turn conversations\n- Reference resolution: \"it\" → specific entity\n- Context maintained across 10-20 turns\n\n### Next Steps\n\nProceed to **M10.4 Concept: Conversational RAG with Memory** to learn how to implement conversation memory for your multi-agent RAG system.\n\n---\n**Bridge Validation Complete**",
