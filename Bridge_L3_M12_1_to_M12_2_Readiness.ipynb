    "### What We Built in M12.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous module delivered five major systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ClickHouse Analytics Database**\n",
    "   - Partitioned tables tracking queries, tokens, and bytes per tenant\n",
    "   - Real-time data ingestion for usage events\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Async Event Tracker with Fallback**\n",
    "   - Non-blocking event capture (prevents API slowdown)\n",
    "   - File-based recovery when ClickHouse unavailable\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Per-Tenant Cost Attribution**\n",
    "   - Conversion of usage metrics to USD using OpenAI pricing + markup\n",
    "   - Costs locked at event time (immutable pricing)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Redis-Based Quota Enforcement**\n",
    "   - Synchronous quota checks blocking requests at limits\n",
    "   - Prevents unexpected charges\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real-Time Dashboards**\n",
    "   - Grafana materialized views\n",
    "   - Sub-second performance for tenant consumption visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem We Still Have\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual billing doesn't scale:**\n",
    "- 50 customers = 10 hours/month manual work ($1,500 opportunity cost)\n",
    "- 100 customers = 40+ hours/month (unsustainable)\n",
    "- Perfect usage data exists, but no automated payment collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**This bridge validates readiness before automating billing in M12.2.**"

Stripe Customer & Subscription Setup\n- Automatic customer creation from tenant signups\n- Plan linking to Stripe price IDs\n- Metered billing model mapping (usage → Stripe reporting API)\n\n#### 2. Automated Invoice Generation\n- Monthly ClickHouse-to-Stripe export pipeline\n- Itemized invoices with line-item breakdowns\n- Automatic email distribution to customers\n\n#### 3. Payment Collection & Dunning\n- Automatic charge attempts on invoice creation\n- Retry logic at days 3, 7, and 14 for failed payments\n- Webhook notifications for payment events (success/failure)\n\n#### 4. Subscription Lifecycle Management\n- Trial-to-paid conversion workflows\n- Mid-month upgrades/downgrades with proration\n- Cancellation handling and final invoicing\n\n---\n\n### Business Impact\n\n**Time savings:**\n- 50 customers: 10 hours/month → 0 hours (automated)\n- 200 customers: 40+ hours/month → 0 hours (automated)\n- **Scales to unlimited customers with zero manual intervention**\n\n**Cost reduction:**\n- Eliminates $1,500-3,000/month opportunity cost\n- Prevents billing disputes ($500-2,000 per incident)\n- Accelerates payment collection (5-10 day improvement)\n\n---\n\n### Bridge Validation Complete\n\n**If all four readiness checks passed above, you are ready to proceed to M12.2.**\n\nNext: Build Stripe integration and automate end-to-end billing.",
