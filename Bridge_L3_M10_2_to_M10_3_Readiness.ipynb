    "# Bridge: M10.2 Tool Calling → M10.3 Multi-Agent Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This bridge validates that your tool calling infrastructure from M10.2 is production-ready before adding the complexity of multi-agent coordination in M10.3. A single agent calling tools is powerful—but when tasks require independent validation, parallel execution, or role separation (planner vs. executor vs. validator), you need orchestrated specialists. This notebook ensures your foundation is solid: tools work reliably, sandboxing prevents security issues, error handling degrades gracefully, and monitoring tracks performance metrics essential for debugging multi-agent systems."
